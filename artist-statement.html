	<div id="artist-statement"> <p>My name is rossie.  </p>
		
		<p>I am an artist, musician, and community organizer that has been living, learning, and playing on Yelamu land (now referred to as San Francisco) for ~10 years.  I grew up 20 miles south of SF and am deeply indebted to the rolling hills and dreams of a progressive utopia that have shaped my understanding of a lived environment. </p>
	
		<p>I draw heavily from my background as a food sovereignty organizer, a scholar and former research assistant in the field of Geography, a former freelance photojournalist, and a mestiza (mixed native american and european descent) queer.</p>

		<p>I am interested in ways of examining settler colonialism and reindigenizing our relations in the context of displacement and modernization. </p>

		<p>I explore concepts of home, nature, memory, and the body while considering ideas on spirituality, quantum physics, and meta physics. My mediums include collage, illustration, web design, photography, poetry, essay, video, performance, installation, and social practice.  </p>
