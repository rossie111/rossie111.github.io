	<div id="artist-statement"> <p>My name is Rossie.  I am a visual artist, writer, and community organizer and have been living, learning, and playing in Yelamu land (now referred to as San Francisco) for the last 10 years.  I grew up 20 miles south of San Francisco and am deeply indebted to the rolling hills and dreams of a progressive utopia that have shaped my understanding of limitiations and possibility of a lived environment. </p>
	
	<p>I draw heavily from my background as a food sovereignty organizer, a scholar and former research assistant in the field of Geography, a former freelance photojournalist, and a mestiza (mixed native american and European descent) queer.</p>

	<p>I am interested in ways of examining settler colonialism and reindigenizing our relations in the context of displacement and modernization. </p>

	<p>I explore concepts of home, nature, memory, and the body while considering ideas on spirituality, quantum physics, and meta physics.  My mediums include collage, illustration, photography, poetry, essay, video, performance, installation, and social practice.  </p>

<h2>Decolonizing My Mind</h2>
<h3>Winter 2019</h3>
	<div id="decolonize"> <p>This installation turned virtual gallery explores the 21st century indoctrination into  white supremacy, capitalism, imperialism, religion, and indigeneity on colonized lands.  Inside is a collage and several found objects including a colonial simulation game for children, clothing, and an [interactive] altar serving as a device to mediate healing and greater truths beyond oppressive systems and social constructions. 
<P>
Here is a little bit on the items in the room: 
Discovery 3 is a role playing activity that "recreates in your classroom some of the mysteries, hardships, and excitement faced by early American colonist." This simulation game was completed as part of a 5th grade assignment at Nesbit Elementary School in Belmont, just 22 miles south of San Francisco.  Despite being in a 'progressive hub', white supremacy and colonialism was normalized at an early age.  
<P>
Clothing found here are personal items that represent my culture: a traditional Mexican dress and an Andean 2 piece outfit from my childhood.  Both pieces and my relationship to them represent my connection to my cultures--although neither item truly relates to my direct lineage.  For example, there are many traditional dresses in Mexico related to a particular region.  I do not know what region this dress is associated with, and regardless it is still personally significant because it is one the closest symbolic items that displays my Mexican-ness.  In addition, the child's Andean outfit I have had in possession since my childhood, yet similarly my family's indigenous origins in Peru are more closely tied to the Amazonian region, not Andean.  And yet it is still personally significant as a symbolic tie to my Peruvian identity.  

The third clothing item here is a first-communion dress and shall--a cultural rite of passage in latin-american catholic households. 
<p>
In this room you will also find an altar with items and tools that help me navigate my ethereal and physical connection to my ancestors, spirit and how to walk my own unique path.  
<p>
I hope learning about my journey exploring my identity also helps you reflect on your relationship to systems of oppression that need to be examined, exposed, and released in order to allow collective, personal, and transformational healing.
